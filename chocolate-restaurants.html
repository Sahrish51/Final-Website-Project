			<p>Chocolat takes its name from of the fruit of the cacao seed, after it has surrendered itself in liquid, becoming what the Aztecs called the nectar of the gods, the sweat of stars. Cross the threshold of Chocolat Restaurant Lounge and enter a world where urban meets the urbane and the sophistication of the surroundings twins the pleasures of the palate. The eclectic menu features succulent meats, the freshest seafood, and straight from the garden salads and vegetables, seasoned with hints of spices from around the planet. There are new creations and new takes on some old favorites, all prepared with the precision, skill and care to satisfy the most discriminating tastes. Pair your meal with an imaginative cocktail or a robust wine, and a finishing note of one of Chocolat’s delectable desserts to cap off a feast of culinary delights.Whether it’s an intimate evening for two or happy hour at the bar, dinner with colleagues or a family gathering for brunch, hang time with the girls or watching the game with the fellas; from the dark and sensual espresso -toned private room, to the window-lined, art-filled main room and balcony seating slightly overlooking it all, Chocolat has the ambience to fit every occasion.</p>
